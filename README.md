<h1><strong>SMS Spam Classifier</strong></h1>
This project aims to classify SMS messages as either spam or ham (non-spam) using machine learning techniques.

<h1><strong>Overview</strong></h1>
The SMS Spam Classifier utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques along with machine learning algorithms to classify SMS messages.<br>
The process involves preprocessing the text data, extracting relevant features, and training a model to predict whether a message is spam or ham.<br>

<h1><strong>Dataset</strong></h1>
The dataset used in this project contains a collection of SMS messages labeled as spam or ham.<br>
Dataset on kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset<br>

<h1><strong>Techniques Used</strong></h1>
Text Preprocessing: removal of stopwords, and stemming.<br>
Feature Extraction: Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).<br>
Machine Learning Algorithms: Various classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, Voting Classifier, and Stacking Classifier.<br>
Evaluation: Performance metrics including accuracy, and precision are used to assess the classifier's effectiveness.
