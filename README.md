**SMS Spam Classifier**  
This project aims to classify SMS messages as either spam or ham (non-spam) using machine learning techniques.

**Overview**  
The SMS Spam Classifier utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques along with machine learning algorithms to classify SMS messages.   
The process involves preprocessing the text data, extracting relevant features, and training a model to predict whether a message is spam or ham.  

__Dataset__  
The dataset used in this project contains a collection of SMS messages labeled as spam or ham.    
dataset on kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset  

__Techniques Used__  
Text Preprocessing: removal of stopwords, and stemming.  
Feature Extraction: Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).  
Machine Learning Algorithms: Various classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, Voting Classifier, and Stacking Classifier.  
Evaluation: Performance metrics including accuracy, and precision are used to assess the classifier's effectiveness.
